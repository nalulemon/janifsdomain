<b><h1 align= "center">Past, Present and Future</h1></b>
<p align = "center">To dwell on the past or the future is a question that I struggle with so heavily. You learn from the past to excel in the future. In a sense, both are important, but in reality, neither is. The present is what I focus on; after all, it is a gift. Although this is the mentality I’ve resolved to maintain, it is difficult to prevent your thoughts from going astray. What if I do this? How can I do that? It's an endless cycle of meaningless malarkey, and it's truly irrelevant. Your regrets are unimportant. No matter what you do, you can’t change the past, but if you could, what would you do? And thus, the cycle restarts. To be so narrow-minded is normally a flaw in the eyes of many; different perspectives can give rise to more creative thinking, but there is a limit to how much information your brain can feasibly handle. Sometimes, your brain shouldn’t know certain things. It shouldn’t know that you're a useless excuse of a person with no drive or motivation other than the materialistic vanities that are as permanent as the hair on our bodies. It shouldn’t know that everyone’s eyes are slowly turning away as they begin to realize that you are nothing like what you claimed to be. It shouldn’t know that potential is a projection, its validity is not protected, and often you become what you are not expected to. Sometimes it's okay to be content. I hate that thought, but it is unhealthy to be so consistently unhappy. You may lose the height of your ceiling, yet the floor you sit on is a lot more comfortable. Why should I hate myself because of some made-up standard that I continue to impose? What is stopping me from amounting to nothing and being okay with that? This is getting off-topic. In conclusion, the past is sad, and the future is scary. I hate them both. Instead of dying in the past or dying in the future, I’d rather die right now.</p>
