<b><h1 align= "center">What it Means to be an Adult</h1></b>
<p align = "center">Do you ever just feel useless? You feel like you could be productive, everything you should be doing is right at your doorstep, yet you continue to ignore it. The reason is simple, it's too hard. It's too difficult and terrifying to take a step out of your comfort zone and commit to what you should be doing, as it's almost never what you want to be doing. Overcoming that barrier depends solely on your resolve, you can’t run to anybody else, and you can’t rely on others to do things for you, as you seemingly have been your entire life, this all lies upon you. Responsibility is truly a lot to bear, but it's the fundamental aspect of being an adult. I’ve become very good at pretending to be productive, living in lies is where I thrive. Rather than actually taking steps to my supposed goals, I’d rather waste my time and enjoy my life, cause who doesn’t want that, right? The only issue is that life is not so simple that you can just get by while doing what you want. I’ve had to see the hard way that with everyone running circles around me, I’ve stood still, I haven’t moved an inch and it's cost me dearly. In the end, I’m useless. I fear responsibility and I fear taking the first step towards change, towards adulthood. I don’t want to be an adult. I don’t want to be alone.</p>
